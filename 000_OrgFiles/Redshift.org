#+STARTUP: hideblocks show2levels

* Introduction

~Redshift~ is an application that *automatically adjust* the ~Display Lights~ depending on the *time of day*.
This is done by adjusting the ~Color Temperature~ using *Gamma Ramps*.
It's more of a hack, but supposedly helps especially *at night* when ~Blue Light~ might be problematic.

* Global Settings

#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Global settings for redshift
  [redshift]
#+end_src

** Day/Night Temperatures
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Set the day and night screen temperatures
  temp-day=5700
  temp-night=3500
#+end_src

** Smooth Fading on Start/Stop
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Disable the smooth fade between temperatures when Redshift starts and stops.
  ; 0 will cause an immediate change between screen temperatures.
  ; 1 will gradually apply the new screen temperature over a couple of seconds.
  fade=1
#+end_src

** Specify Start/Stop Criteria
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Solar elevation thresholds.
  ; By default, Redshift will use the current elevation of the sun to determine
  ; whether it is daytime, night or in transition (dawn/dusk). When the sun is
  ; above the degrees specified with elevation-high it is considered daytime and
  ; below elevation-low it is considered night.
  ;elevation-high=3
  ;elevation-low=-6

  ; Custom dawn/dusk intervals.
  ; Instead of using the solar elevation, the time intervals of dawn and dusk
  ; can be specified manually. The times must be specified as HH:MM in 24-hour
  ; format.
  dawn-time=6:00-7:45
  dusk-time=18:35-20:15
#+end_src

** Screen Brightness
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Set the screen brightness. Default is 1.0.
  ;brightness=0.9
  ; It is also possible to use different settings for day and night
  ; since version 1.8.
  brightness-day=0.7
  brightness-night=0.4
#+end_src

** Screen Gamma
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Set the screen gamma (for all colors, or each color channel
  ; individually)
  gamma=0.8
  ;gamma=0.8:0.7:0.8
  ; This can also be set individually for day and night since
  ; version 1.10.
  ;gamma-day=0.8:0.7:0.8
  ;gamma-night=0.6
#+end_src

** Location Provider
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Set the location-provider: 'geoclue2', 'manual'
  ; type 'redshift -l list' to see possible values.
  ; The location provider settings are in a different section.
  location-provider=manual
#+end_src

** Adustment Method
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Set the adjustment-method: 'randr', 'vidmode'
  ; type 'redshift -m list' to see all possible values.
  ; 'randr' is the preferred method, 'vidmode' is an older API.
  ; but works in some cases when 'randr' does not.
  ; The adjustment method settings are in a different section.
  adjustment-method=randr
#+end_src

* Configuration of Location Provider
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Configuration of the location-provider:
  ; type 'redshift -l PROVIDER:help' to see the settings.
  ; ex: 'redshift -l manual:help'
  ; Keep in mind that longitudes west of Greenwich (e.g. the Americas)
  ; are negative numbers.
  [manual]
  lat=48.1
  lon=11.6
#+end_src

* Configuration of Adjustment Method
#+begin_src shell tangle: yes
  ; Configuration of the adjustment-method
  ; type 'redshift -m METHOD:help' to see the settings.
  ; ex: 'redshift -m randr:help'
  ; In this example, randr is configured to adjust only screen 0.
  ; Note that the numbering starts from 0, so this is actually the first screen.
  ; If this option is not specified, Redshift will try to adjust _all_ screens.
  [randr]
  screen=0
#+end_src
